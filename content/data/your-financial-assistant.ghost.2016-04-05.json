Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!\n\n> Ghost - Just a blogging platform\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider.

Since mortgage rates have remained fairly low in the past few years, it's become a popular way for homeowners to reduce their interest rates and in some cases, take some cash out of their home equity. While finding a good deal on a mortgage refinance loan might offer you a good opportunity, there might also be some drawbacks that you should consider.\n\n### Benefits of Home Mortgage Refinancing\nThe main reasons that people get sold on refinancing is as a way to reduce their interest rate. If you are paying eight percent on your mortgage and could refinance at five percent, you could save lots of money over the course of a 15- or 30-year mortgage term. This might improve your financial situation because you will have more money to save for the future or to reduce other kinds of debt.\n\nSome folks also decide to change the term of their mortgage when they refinance. For example, you might have taken out an original mortgage for 30 years. At this point in your life, you may decide you would rather pay your balance off in 15 years. Typically, interest rates on a 15-year note are cheaper than they are for a 30-year note, and you get to pay your loan off faster.\n\nAlternatively, you may go the other way and decide to stretch your payments out for another 30 years in order to reduce monthly payments. If interest rates are considerably lower for a new mortgage than your old one, the actual payment might be the same or even lower. You will just have to make more payments. Most mortgage companies allow their customers to pay ahead, so you might still end up getting your loan paid off faster. You just have the option to stretch payments out.\n\nFinally, people who have a decent amount of home equity may decide that they would benefit by cashing it out. Equity is defined as the difference between the amount of money that your house is valued at and the amount you still owe on your mortgage. Most lenders require their borrowers to keep about 20 percent equity in their homes, so this won't work for everybody. Still, it can be a good solution for people who have lived in their houses long enough to build up a good amount of equity and can use the cash to benefit them in some way.\n\n### When is Mortgage Refinancing a Bad Idea?\nFirst, you should know that refinancing usually isn't free. You may have to pay some fees, closing costs, and other expenses to qualify for your new loan. For example, you might have to pay to get your house appraised. It is possible to roll some of these costs into your new loan, but you may end up with a larger loan balance than you started with. It's always a good idea to shop around to find a broker or lender who will find you the best deal.\n\n### Should You Refinance Your House?\nIt's important to weigh the costs and benefits of replacing your old loan. If you can save money with lower interest rates or use the money from your home equity to improve your financial situation, it could be a good idea. You might begin by speaking with a mortgage broker to see how refinancing would work for you.","html":"<p><img class=\"img-responsive pull-right\" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/consumer-alerts/image/upload/v1459203381/yfa/584_photo.jpg\"></img> <br />\nRefinancing is simply a way to replace your old mortgage with a new one.

For example, you might have taken out an original mortgage for 30 years. At this point in your life, you may decide you would rather pay your balance off in 15 years. Typically, interest rates on a 15-year note are cheaper than they are for a 30-year note, and you get to pay your loan off faster.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you may go the other way and decide to stretch your payments out for another 30 years in order to reduce monthly payments. If interest rates are considerably lower for a new mortgage than your old one, the actual payment might be the same or even lower. You will just have to make more payments. Most mortgage companies allow their customers to pay ahead, so you might still end up getting your loan paid off faster. You just have the option to stretch payments out.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, people who have a decent amount of home equity may decide that they would benefit by cashing it out. Equity is defined as the difference between the amount of money that your house is valued at and the amount you still owe on your mortgage. Most lenders require their borrowers to keep about 20 percent equity in their homes, so this won't work for everybody. Still, it can be a good solution for people who have lived in their houses long enough to build up a good amount of equity and can use the cash to benefit them in some way.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whenismortgagerefinancingabadidea\">When is Mortgage Refinancing a Bad Idea?</h3>\n\n<p>First, you should know that refinancing usually isn't free. You may have to pay some fees, closing costs, and other expenses to qualify for your new loan. For example, you might have to pay to get your house appraised. It is possible to roll some of these costs into your new loan, but you may end up with a larger loan balance than you started with. It's always a good idea to shop around to find a broker or lender who will find you the best deal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"shouldyourefinanceyourhouse\">Should You Refinance Your House?</h3>\n\n<p>It's important to weigh the costs and benefits of replacing your old loan. If you can save money with lower interest rates or use the money from your home equity to improve your financial situation, it could be a good idea. You might begin by speaking with a mortgage broker to see how refinancing would work for you.</p>","image":"//res.cloudinary.com/consumer-alerts/image/upload/v1459203381/yfa/584_photo.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1459203322371,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1459820141102,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1459203410885,"published_by":1},{"id":8,"uuid":"e4ca8cf3-4fe6-410d-8fdd-732d5013e1b1","title":"Will Chips In Credit Cards Stop Fraud?","slug":"will-chips-in-credit-cards-stop-fraud","markdown":"<img class=\"img-responsive pull-right\" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/consumer-alerts/image/upload/v1459203675/yfa/600_photo.jpg\"></img>\nIn the past few years, companies that issue credit cards have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to give their customers better security with credit cards that contain microchip technology.

Currency is always traded in pairs: the numerator is the currency you buy, the denominator represents the sold currency. MACD is a form of technical analysis -- the prediction of future prices using past data. MACD relies heavily on moving averages - the running average of the previous n-number of time periods (typically, an hour). To be more precise, MACD relies on two moving averages (\"fast\" and \"slow\") of the *difference between two other moving averages* to identify a trend.\n\n###Moving Averages\nThink first of a simple average, say of the last 26 hourly prices on the EUR/USD currency pair. If you sum the prices in the collection and divide by 26, you have the average price for the collection. Let an hour elapse and do it again. What has happened is that the oldest price has fallen out of your price collection, replaced by the most recent price. Assuming the oldest and newest prices are different, the price collection will have a new average each hour: the moving average of the latest 26 periods. The effect of a moving average is to create a plotted line that \"smooths\" out the actual hourly price action. The greater the number of periods in the average, the slower the responsiveness of the moving average to changes.\n\n###Difference Lines\nYou start with two primary moving averages of hourly prices of a FOREX currency pair. The first is the average of the last 26 hourly prices; the second is the 12-period moving average. You create the fast average difference line (FADL) by subtracting the 12-period average from the 26-period average. Now, take the nine-period moving average of the FADL and you have the slow average difference line (SADL), which functions to smooth out the FADL.\n\n###Histogram\nA histogram is a simple XY graph of vertical lines representing the distribution of data. Our histogram plots time on the X-axis and the differences between the FADL and the SADL (the MACD band) on the Y-axis. Superimposed upon the two average difference lines, you will notice that the height of the MACD band will shrink (converge) and grow (diverge) periodically over time. This is the key to interpreting MACD. Note that the different price collections (9, 12 and 26 periods) and the length of the time period (one hour) can be varied, or tuned, as a trader sees fit - the effect is to change the responsiveness of MACD to current prices.\n\n###Interpretation\nWhen the FADL crosses the SADL, the difference between the two is zero. As the FADL diverges from the SADL, the histogram height grows. MACD posits that a trend has started when the FADL crosses the SADL and the histogram grows rapidly. When the FADL falls below the SADL on increasing histogram height, MACD is calling for a new downtrend. Conversely, an uptrend occurs when the FADL pierces the SADL from below as histogram height rapidly grows. Because the MACD relies on moving averages of moving averages, it tends to be to lag other technical indicators. Traders therefore view it as a confirmation of a trend that may already have been recognized by other indicators.","html":"<p><img class=\"img-responsive pull-right\" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/uplabsllc/image/upload/v1459820212/590_photo_l5r6xw.jpg\"></img></p>\n\n<p>Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator used to identify the price trend of a FOREX currency pair, such as euro/U.S. dollar (EUR/USD).

MACD relies heavily on moving averages - the running average of the previous n-number of time periods (typically, an hour). To be more precise, MACD relies on two moving averages (\"fast\" and \"slow\") of the <em>difference between two other moving averages</em> to identify a trend.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"movingaverages\">Moving Averages</h3>\n\n<p>Think first of a simple average, say of the last 26 hourly prices on the EUR/USD currency pair. If you sum the prices in the collection and divide by 26, you have the average price for the collection. Let an hour elapse and do it again. What has happened is that the oldest price has fallen out of your price collection, replaced by the most recent price. Assuming the oldest and newest prices are different, the price collection will have a new average each hour: the moving average of the latest 26 periods. The effect of a moving average is to create a plotted line that \"smooths\" out the actual hourly price action. The greater the number of periods in the average, the slower the responsiveness of the moving average to changes.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"differencelines\">Difference Lines</h3>\n\n<p>You start with two primary moving averages of hourly prices of a FOREX currency pair. The first is the average of the last 26 hourly prices; the second is the 12-period moving average. You create the fast average difference line (FADL) by subtracting the 12-period average from the 26-period average. Now, take the nine-period moving average of the FADL and you have the slow average difference line (SADL), which functions to smooth out the FADL.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"histogram\">Histogram</h3>\n\n<p>A histogram is a simple XY graph of vertical lines representing the distribution of data. Our histogram plots time on the X-axis and the differences between the FADL and the SADL (the MACD band) on the Y-axis. Superimposed upon the two average difference lines, you will notice that the height of the MACD band will shrink (converge) and grow (diverge) periodically over time. This is the key to interpreting MACD. Note that the different price collections (9, 12 and 26 periods) and the length of the time period (one hour) can be varied, or tuned, as a trader sees fit - the effect is to change the responsiveness of MACD to current prices.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"interpretation\">Interpretation</h3>\n\n<p>When the FADL crosses the SADL, the difference between the two is zero. As the FADL diverges from the SADL, the histogram height grows. MACD posits that a trend has started when the FADL crosses the SADL and the histogram grows rapidly. When the FADL falls below the SADL on increasing histogram height, MACD is calling for a new downtrend. Conversely, an uptrend occurs when the FADL pierces the SADL from below as histogram height rapidly grows. Because the MACD relies on moving averages of moving averages, it tends to be to lag other technical indicators. Traders therefore view it as a confirmation of a trend that may already have been recognized by other indicators.</p>","image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/uplabsllc/image/upload/v1459820212/590_photo_l5r6xw.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1459820173663,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1459820307789,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1459820307789,"published_by":1},{"id":13,"uuid":"f0384968-2723-40bb-bf07-66ea31395cce","title":"When Is The Best Time To Start Collecting Social Security Payments?","slug":"when-is-the-best-time-to-start-collecting-social-security-payments","markdown":"<img class=\"img-responsive pull-right\" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/uplabsllc/image/upload/c_scale,h_300/v1459820368/594_photo_s0rhhd.jpg\"></img>\nFor many years, age 65 was considered a typical retirement age. However, most younger Americans will have to wait longer to collect full retirement benefits now because the social security retirement age keeps increasing. People who were born after 1937 need to wait until age 66 and beyond for full benefits.\n\nThe government also allows qualified recipients to choose to begin their payments as early as age 62 or as late as age 70. Obviously, the earlier that payments start, the lower each payment will be. This can make it difficult for some retirees to figure out the best time to begin collecting their social security income.\n\n###Is it Better To Take Social Security Payments Earlier or Later?\nThis offers a rough estimate of the differences between collecting social security at different times for an individual who qualified for full retirement benefits at age 66:\n\n* At 62, estimate that payments will be about 75 percent of what they would be at full retirement.\n* At age 65, the payments would be about 93 percent of full retirement benefits.\n* Beyond full retirement age, figure on an increase of about eight percent for each additional year.\n\nThe government bases the size of payments upon earnings and actuarial tables with the life expectancy for average people. Both of these things might factor into a decision about the best way to time social security payments. By delaying payments, some people might have a chance to earn more money and qualify for larger checks both because they waited and because they have a higher income to use to qualify.\n\nOn the other hand, people who take their checks early will be sure to receive more total checks than they would if they had waited. Since nobody can predict how long he or she will live or exactly how much money might be made, the decision might be based upon a number of uncertainties. There is no way for most people to know for sure which choice will result in a greater amount of total payments.\n\n###Calculating the Best Time to Collect Social Security\nBecause there are so many unknowns, figuring out when to begin collecting social security might seem a little bit like gambling. The right decision could depend upon savings, income, and even health. A 62-year-old might decide to take smaller payments because the extra income would help maintain a comfortable lifestyle. A healthy 69-year-old might decide to wait another year because the money isn't needed at the moment. This is a personal choice that's different for people with different circumstances.\n\nThe Social Security Administration does offer some free retirement calculators that can help people figure out how their own payments would be affected by a decision to take payments early or wait until later.

Since mortgage rates have remained fairly low in the past few years, it's become a popular way for homeowners to reduce their interest rates and in some cases, take some cash out of their home equity. While finding a good deal on a mortgage refinance loan might offer you a good opportunity, there might also be some drawbacks that you should consider.\n\n### Benefits of Home Mortgage Refinancing\nThe main reasons that people get sold on refinancing is as a way to reduce their interest rate. If you are paying eight percent on your mortgage and could refinance at five percent, you could save lots of money over the course of a 15- or 30-year mortgage term. This might improve your financial situation because you will have more money to save for the future or to reduce other kinds of debt.\n\nSome folks also decide to change the term of their mortgage when they refinance. For example, you might have taken out an original mortgage for 30 years. At this point in your life, you may decide you would rather pay your balance off in 15 years. Typically, interest rates on a 15-year note are cheaper than they are for a 30-year note, and you get to pay your loan off faster.\n\nAlternatively, you may go the other way and decide to stretch your payments out for another 30 years in order to reduce monthly payments. If interest rates are considerably lower for a new mortgage than your old one, the actual payment might be the same or even lower. You will just have to make more payments. Most mortgage companies allow their customers to pay ahead, so you might still end up getting your loan paid off faster. You just have the option to stretch payments out.\n\nFinally, people who have a decent amount of home equity may decide that they would benefit by cashing it out. Equity is defined as the difference between the amount of money that your house is valued at and the amount you still owe on your mortgage. Most lenders require their borrowers to keep about 20 percent equity in their homes, so this won't work for everybody. Still, it can be a good solution for people who have lived in their houses long enough to build up a good amount of equity and can use the cash to benefit them in some way.\n\n### When is Mortgage Refinancing a Bad Idea?\nFirst, you should know that refinancing usually isn't free. You may have to pay some fees, closing costs, and other expenses to qualify for your new loan. For example, you might have to pay to get your house appraised. It is possible to roll some of these costs into your new loan, but you may end up with a larger loan balance than you started with. It's always a good idea to shop around to find a broker or lender who will find you the best deal.\n\n### Should You Refinance Your House?\nIt's important to weigh the costs and benefits of replacing your old loan. If you can save money with lower interest rates or use the money from your home equity to improve your financial situation, it could be a good idea. You might begin by speaking with a mortgage broker to see how refinancing would work for you.","html":"<p><img class=\"img-responsive pull-right\" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/uplabsllc/image/upload/v1459203381/yfa/584_photo.jpg\"></img> <br />\nRefinancing is simply a way to replace your old mortgage with a new one.

Likewise, large retailers have invested even more money in the hardware that they need to read these cards. However, some critics don't believe that the new cards will really eliminate fraud. In fact, they fear that microchips in credit cards will only shift the way that thieves commit credit card fraud.\n\n### Chip and PIN Compared to Chip and Signature Credit Cards\nThis new technology makes use of a chip that contains the encrypted information that used to be stored in the magnetic strip on the back of the card. Besides the encrypted data in the chip, the machines that read these cards also generate one-time transaction codes. That means criminals can't just steal the information and embed it into another card.\n\nThe first complaint about the new cards is that credit card companies are distributing chip and signature cards. Executives of the Retail Industry Leaders Association say that chip and PIN cards have proven themselves to be more effective. According to critics, signatures are fairly easy to forge.

A criminal might not have any way to know a secret PIN code, but he or she might be able to find a signature to copy from another document in a stolen purse or wallet.\n\nThe second problem is that neither type of new credit card will help prevent online fraud. Very often, only a credit card number and expiration date are still required for these. That's why critics fear that the new microchip technology will just shift the way fraud gets done and not eliminate it. In fact, many places that already have this new technology in place have suffered from an increase in Internet fraud.\n\nWith present technology, the only way to truly reduce online fraud might be to require consumers to use a personal card reader to make transactions.

At the same time, almost 30 percent will choose a Medicare Advantage plan. Supplements used to be more popular, and it's fairly obvious that Medicare Advantage has gained in popularity at the expense of supplements. Given a choice between Medicare supplements and Medicare Advantage, why do some people still choose a supplement?\n\nIt's fairly easy to account for the popularity of Medicare Advantage plans. For one thing, many come with no additional premium. Even those that do have a premium are usually modestly priced. They might also include prescription benefits. Alternatively, supplements always have a premium and don't include Part D prescription coverage. People who choose a supplement usually also have to purchase a Part D plan.\n\n### Why Consider Medicare Supplement Insurance?\nThere are many different standardized levels of supplements. They are assigned letter names from A through N. The most comprehensive options, Plan C and Plan F, are the most expensive. The interesting thing is that they are also the most popular. Most people who decide to buy supplements are also willing to buy the most expensive supplements.\n\nWhen comparing people who decide to have a supplement instead Medicare Advantage, it seems clear that supplement buyers are less concerned about the cost of premiums. It's very important to realize that the most robust plan levels can also reduce or eliminate concerns about out-of-pocket costs. For beneficiaries who decide to buy supplements, benefits seem more important than premiums. Most Medicare Advantage plans still have deductibles and copays that leave their members vulnerable to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nAlso, most Medicare Advantage plans rely upon plan networks to control health costs. People who buy a supplement usually don't have to worry about HMO or PPO restrictions. Supplement owners can pick any doctor who takes Medicare, don't need referrals to get to a specialist, and are likely to have many more medical providers to choose from.\n\nSupplements work all over the United States. Some even provide emergency coverage in foreign countries. Medicare Advantage plan members are not likely to enjoy these benefits. People who travel a lot are more likely to enjoy the flexibility of a supplement.\n\n### Is a Medicare Supplement the Best Choice?\nBoth of these types of Medicare health insurance policies have advantages and disadvantages. The right choice is likely to depend upon an individual's health, budget, and preferences. It's probably a good idea for beneficiaries to compare options in their own local area to see which choice will be more likely to satisfy their own unique needs.\n","html":"<p><img class=\"img-responsive pull-right\" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/uplabsllc/image/upload/v1459205262/yfa/599_photo.jpg\"></img></p>\n\n<p>Recently, the Kaiser Family Foundation predicted that somewhat over one out of five Medicare beneficiaries would select a Medicare supplement plan in the coming year.

The right choice is likely to depend upon an individual's health, budget, and preferences. It's probably a good idea for beneficiaries to compare options in their own local area to see which choice will be more likely to satisfy their own unique needs.</p>","image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/uplabsllc/image/upload/v1459205262/yfa/599_photo.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1459205232000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1459843439000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1459205344000,"published_by":1},{"id":22,"uuid":"d07c5658-0da6-4e1f-9365-c83665367be7","title":"When To Consider Applying For A Store Credit Card","slug":"when-to-consider-applying-for-a-store-credit-card-2","markdown":"<img class=\"img-responsive pull-right\" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/uplabsllc/image/upload/v1459819763/595_photo_e9kc8d.jpg\"></img>\n\nAt some stores, you may get offered an application for a credit card every time you pass by the checkout counter. Businesses can increase their revenues by offering credit, so they encourage their clerks to convince customers to fill out applications. Of course, stores usually also offer their customers an incentive. This might come in the form of an additional discount or delayed interest charges.\n\n###When to Consider a Store Credit Card\nSome offers may be too good to refuse. Consider some reasons to consider applying for a store credit card:\n\n* **Financing offers**: Having a chance to delay interest on an expensive purchase is really the same as a discount. You can make minimum payments and leave your cash invested until the promotional period ends.\n* **Discounts**: New card holders might also be offered an additional discount on purchases they make with their new cards. If the purchase can be paid off right away, there won't be any interest charges to offset the discount.\n* **Loyalty programs**: Some stores also offer great loyalty programs to their card holders. They might have exclusive offers and deals that aren't offered to anybody else.\n* **Ability to establish credit**: It might be easier to qualify for a store credit card than a general card. Wise use of this card could help you improve your credit score in order to access other cards or loans.\n###Why Decline a Store Credit Card?\nThe promotional financing offers might sound like a great deal. However, they always end after several months. If you haven't paid off your entire purchase by then, the creditor might be able to tack all the interest you would have paid onto your balance. They can also do this if you are ever late with a minimum payment. If either of these things happen, the promotional offer will end up costing you money and saving you nothing. It's only a good idea to take advantage of one of these financing offers if you are sure that you can adhere to the terms.\n\nYou might also be tempted to buy things that you really haven't budgeted for just because you have a store credit card. Obviously, the company will do everything in its power to send you offers for things that you might want but really don't need. If you already have credit issues, you probably don't need to open up another invitation to run up debt.\n\nFinally, store cards are usually limited to that one store or chain of stores. If you only want to hold a certain number of credit cards, it's probably a better idea to look for a general card that you can use almost anywhere.\n\n###Should You Take the Clerk's Offer of a Store Credit Card?\nIf you tend to patronize a certain store regularly, you might benefit from additional discounts, promotional financing, and a good loyalty program.

Currency is always traded in pairs: the numerator is the currency you buy, the denominator represents the sold currency. MACD is a form of technical analysis -- the prediction of future prices using past data. MACD relies heavily on moving averages - the running average of the previous n-number of time periods (typically, an hour). To be more precise, MACD relies on two moving averages (\"fast\" and \"slow\") of the *difference between two other moving averages* to identify a trend.\n\n###Moving Averages\nThink first of a simple average, say of the last 26 hourly prices on the EUR/USD currency pair. If you sum the prices in the collection and divide by 26, you have the average price for the collection. Let an hour elapse and do it again. What has happened is that the oldest price has fallen out of your price collection, replaced by the most recent price. Assuming the oldest and newest prices are different, the price collection will have a new average each hour: the moving average of the latest 26 periods. The effect of a moving average is to create a plotted line that \"smooths\" out the actual hourly price action. The greater the number of periods in the average, the slower the responsiveness of the moving average to changes.\n\n###Difference Lines\nYou start with two primary moving averages of hourly prices of a FOREX currency pair. The first is the average of the last 26 hourly prices; the second is the 12-period moving average. You create the fast average difference line (FADL) by subtracting the 12-period average from the 26-period average. Now, take the nine-period moving average of the FADL and you have the slow average difference line (SADL), which functions to smooth out the FADL.\n\n###Histogram\nA histogram is a simple XY graph of vertical lines representing the distribution of data. Our histogram plots time on the X-axis and the differences between the FADL and the SADL (the MACD band) on the Y-axis. Superimposed upon the two average difference lines, you will notice that the height of the MACD band will shrink (converge) and grow (diverge) periodically over time. This is the key to interpreting MACD. Note that the different price collections (9, 12 and 26 periods) and the length of the time period (one hour) can be varied, or tuned, as a trader sees fit - the effect is to change the responsiveness of MACD to current prices.\n\n###Interpretation\nWhen the FADL crosses the SADL, the difference between the two is zero. As the FADL diverges from the SADL, the histogram height grows. MACD posits that a trend has started when the FADL crosses the SADL and the histogram grows rapidly. When the FADL falls below the SADL on increasing histogram height, MACD is calling for a new downtrend. Conversely, an uptrend occurs when the FADL pierces the SADL from below as histogram height rapidly grows. Because the MACD relies on moving averages of moving averages, it tends to be to lag other technical indicators. Traders therefore view it as a confirmation of a trend that may already have been recognized by other indicators.","html":"<p><img class=\"img-responsive pull-right\" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/uplabsllc/image/upload/v1459820212/590_photo_l5r6xw.jpg\"></img></p>\n\n<p>Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator used to identify the price trend of a FOREX currency pair, such as euro/U.S. dollar (EUR/USD).

However, most younger Americans will have to wait longer to collect full retirement benefits now because the social security retirement age keeps increasing.
